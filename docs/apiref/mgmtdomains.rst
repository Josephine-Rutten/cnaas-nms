Management domains
==================

Management domain can be retreived, added, updated an removed using this API.

Get all managment domains
-------------------------

All management domains can be listed using CURL:


::

   curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_AUTH_TOKEN" ${CNAASURL}/api/v1.0/mgmtdomains

That will return a JSON structured response which describes all domains available:

::

  {
      "status": "success",
      "data": {
          "mgmtdomains": [
              {
                  "id": 10,
                  "ipv4_gw": "10.0.6.1/24",
                  "device_a_id": 9,
                  "device_a_ip": null,
                  "device_b_id": 12,
                  "device_b_ip": null,
                  "site_id": null,
                  "vlan": 600,
                  "description": null,
                  "esi_mac": null,
                  "device_a": "eosdist",
                  "device_b": "eosdist2"
              }
          ]
      }
  }

Note that some of these fields does not have a use case (yet).

You can also specify one specifc mgmtdomain to query by using:

::

   curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_AUTH_TOKEN" ${CNAASURL}/api/v1.0/mgmtdomain/10



Add management domain
---------------------

To add a new management domain we can to call the API with a few fields set in a JSON structure:

::

   * ipv4_gw (mandatory): The IPv4 gateway to be used, should be expressed with a prefix (10.0.0.1/24)
   * device_a (mandatory): Hostname of the first device
   * device_b (mandatory): Hostname of the second device
   * vlan (mandatory): A VLAN ID

device_a and device_b should be a pair of DIST devices that are connected to a
specific set of access devices that should share the same management network.
It's also possible to specify two CORE devices if there is a need to have the
gateway/routing for all access switch management done in the CORE layer instead.
In the case where two CORE devices are specified there should only be one single
mgmtdomain defined for the entire NMS, and this mgmtdomain can only contain
exactly two CORE devices even if there are more CORE devices in the network.

Example using CURL:

::

   curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_AUTH_TOKEN" ${CNAASURL}/api/v1.0/mgmtdomains -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"ipv4_gw": "10.0.6.1/24", "device_a": "dist1", "device_b": "dist2", "vlan": 600}'


Update management domain
------------------------

To update a doamin, we can send a PUT request and specify its ID. We will have to send the same JSON structure as when adding a new domain:

::

   curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_AUTH_TOKEN" ${CNAASURL}/api/v1.0/mgmtdomain/4 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT -d '{"ipv4_gw": "10.0.6.1/24", "device_a": "dist1", "device_b": "dist2", "vlan": 600}'


Remove management domain
------------------------

We can also remove an existing domain by sending a DELETE request and specify its ID:

Once again using CURL:

::

   curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_AUTH_TOKEN" ${CNAASURL}/api/v1.0/mgmtdomain/4 -X DELETE
